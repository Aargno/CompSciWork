# firefox-extensions-ecosystem
We will be creating a Firefox extension middleware API for cloud storage providers.
This new API will help cloud storage providers to connect Firefox to a cloud storage system. It would also help developers lift the cap of data that can be stored by `storage.local` and allow users to connect Firefox to systems like OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
