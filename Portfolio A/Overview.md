# Overview
## The Client
Our client is Mozilla, the non-profit organisation known for mainly for its
Firefox web browser. Firefox was originally released in 2004, and remains
one of the most popular web browsers to this day, thanks to continued
development and innovation. The domain we will be working with is Firefox's
_WebExtensions_ API, which is a cross-browser system for developing extensions.

## The Task
Our objective is to implement new functionality into the _WebExtensions_ API
that allows developers to save their extension data to a cloud storage provider
(e.g. Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox) rather than to the user's local storage.
This will give the benefit of a larger storage area, as well as the posibillity
of extension data being accessible from any device, instead of being saved
locally to one.
